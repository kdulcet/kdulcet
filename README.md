- 👋 Hi, I’m @kdulcet. I'm a full time musician. I've played around with coding in the past and probably will continue to do so but it's most likely going to be in the pursuit of music and also pretty lightweight stuff. If it ever gets heavy I'll update this! I love music software and electronic music, though, it's my lifeblood.

- 👀 I’m interested in contributing to open source music projects any way I can: Sound design/patch creation, testing, feature ideas, documenatation. Unlikely I would be able to code anything worthwhile but I'm thorough and I write well.

- 🌱 I’m currently trying to learn Lua for Surge's new formula modulator and Reaper's JS enough to make some musical duct tape for myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, uh, I don't know. If you have an open source electronic sound generation doodad and you think I could help with something, lmk!
- 📫 How to reach me: look me up on Discord, kdulcet#7556 or Instagram @kinseydulcet.
